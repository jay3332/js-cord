<sup>
An API wrapper for Discord, made using Javascript.

</p>

----

## Why js-cord?
I've always liked JavaScript's syntax better than Python's, but I tend to use Python more for developing Discord Bots because the API wrapper for Python (discord.py) has more features than the conventional discord.js. This wrapper fixes that, with built in command handling, pagination, debugging, and so much more.

## Installation
You can install js-cord using `npm`:

```

Or, if you want the latest features, clone this repository directly:
```sh
$ npm install git+https://github.com/jay3332/js-cord
```

## Examples
In all of these examples, we assume you have already created a bot and have it's token ready.  
### Basic Bot
```js
const discord = require('js-cord');
const client = new discord.Client();

client.on('ready', () => {
    console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user}`)
});

client.on('message', async (msg) => {
    if (msg.content === 'ping')) {
        await msg.reply('Pong!');
    }
});

client.login(process.env.TOKEN);
```
### Built-in command handler
```js
// Can also be accessed via discord.plugins.commands
const { plugins: { commands } } = require('js-cord');
const bot = new commands.Bot({ prefix: '$' });

bot.on('ready', () => {
    console.log(`Logged in as ${bot.user}`);
});

bot.command('ping', async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.reply('Pong!');
});

bot.login(process.env.TOKEN);
```
